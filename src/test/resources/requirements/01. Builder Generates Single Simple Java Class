As a Builder, I want to generate a single, simple Java class with minimal content so that I can prove the concept.

Scenario 1: Vanilla Generation
	When I set up a Java class with a valid name
	And the Java class has no modifiers
	And the Java class has no class-level comment
	And the Java class has no package
	And the Java class is public
	And the Java class has no generic type
	And the Java class has no supertype declared
	And the Java class implements no interfaces
	And I compile the class
	Then the class will compile without errors
	And the class will have the expected name
	And the class will have the correct visibility modifier
	And the class supertype will be correct
	And the class package will be correct
	And the class will have the expected modifiers
